# Heparin_MD
Computational simulation of heparin and its electrostatic interaction with ions for hydrogel design

Here are some of the scripts used to study the molecular dynamics of the heparin in aqueous solution with added ions.
You can find NAMD equilibration and production scripts, as well as topology and parameters files.
There are also output files as well as tcl scripts to count absorbed ions and python scripts to plot RDF and number of absorbed ions.
